This repository tracks my journey of learning **DSA, Python, and projects** step by step.  
Goal: Build problem-solving skills, Python proficiency, and maintain a professional portfolio.

---

##  Day 1

###  Goals Completed
- [x] Installed Python 3.13.7 and set up virtual environment
- [x] Set up VSCode + pip
- [x] Created GitHub repo + .gitignore
 
### üìù DSA Problems Solved

1. **Two Sum (#1, Easy)**  
   - Approach: Use hash map to store seen numbers; check for complement  
   - Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(n)  
   - Code: `/DSA/Day1/two_sum.py`

 2. **Contains duplicate elements(#217,Easy)**
      - Apprroach:
      1. connect the given  list into set
      2. compare the length of set and length of list
      3. if length of set  less than the length of list
      4. then it contains the duplicate else it does not contain duplicates
    - Time Complexity: O(N),Space Complexity: O(N)

###  Python / Tools Learned
- Python 3.13.7 installed  
- Virtual environment setup (`venv`)  
- VSCode configuration  
- `requirements.txt` creation

###  Notes / Reflection
- Key learning: GitHub workflow, structuring repo, Python environment setup  
- Struggled with: None
- Next steps: Continue DSA problems, explore more Python concepts, start mini-projects
